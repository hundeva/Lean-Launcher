# Important note

Unfortunately, due to lack of time and energy, Lean Launcher did not receive updates for a long time now. This is not going to change, and the repository is now archived. Anyone who wants to, can fork it and work on it though.

## Bug reports

Open an issue, with as much details as you can give, "the launcher crashed" is not going to cut it. Reproduction steps, adb logs, anything that you can provide helps.

## Feature requests
